# Accessories installation and use

This section introduces the installation and use of 01Studio CanMV K230 related accessory modules.

## Heat sink

The heat sink can help CanMV K230 dissipate heat more effectively, especially in high temperature environments to achieve stable operation. Installation is also very simple. Tear off the 3M adhesive at the bottom of the heat sink and stick it on the silk screen frame of K230 and memory chip. Because the heat sink is conductive, be careful not to contact other components (capacitors, resistors) on the circuit board during installation to avoid short circuits.

## Acrylic protection plate

The function of the acrylic base plate is to prevent the bottom of the PCB from short-circuiting with other metal objects and to prevent the solder pins from scratching the desktop. At the same time, the space created at the bottom also improves the heat dissipation effect.

The installation method of the CanMV K230 acrylic base plate is very simple. Tear off the acrylic protective film, embed the copper column in the middle, and tighten the upper and lower ends with M2.5 screws.
